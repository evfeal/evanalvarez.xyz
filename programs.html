        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>
          These next entries are software that I use in my daily life, note that
          all software here must be fully Free (as in freedom)/Libre <br />
          and run on the GNU/Linux operating system. Another (albeit softer)
          requirement that I have is that the program is customizable or
          <br />"hackable" and that the source code is reasonably easy to read.
        </p>
        <h3>Operating System (GNU/Linux)</h3>
        <p>
          Void Linux is my distribution of choice, xbps is really nice and I
          love that you can use musl instead of glibc. Another thing about
          <br />Void is that it uses runit, so no systemd! I have tried other
          distributions in the past, and while Arch, Artix, and Gentoo are
          absolutely<br />
          fantastic, I have found that Void works best for me. At the end of the
          day though, it doesnt really matter what distro you use.
        </p>
        <h3>Window Manager</h3>
        <p>
          I think I have used just about every Linux window manager, they all
          have their pros and cons, BUT, there are a few that I have always
          returned
          <br />to, namely dwm, sway, and bspwm. Currently I am using dwm on my
          laptop and bspwm on my desktop. I think I prefer dwm by just a bit,
          but the <br />setup can be annoying. Like distributions, window
          managers dont really matter, dont fall for the memes about the hot new
          wm or distro just <br />
          use whatever works best for you.
        </p>
        <h3>Terminal Emulator</h3>
        <p>
          I am usually using st with a couple patches, it's enough for me, and
          its pretty fast too. If im not using st, i'll be using something
          like<br />
          alacritty or kitty, regarding those, alacritty is a very good terminal
          emulator but unfortunately does not support ligatures. <br />my build
          of st can be found on my
          <a href="https://github.com/evfeal/">GitHub</a> page.
        </p>
        <h3>Text Editor</h3>
        <p>
          A text editor is a developers best friend, we use it for literally
          everything, as such, it is important that it is comfortable and
          <br />fast, My modified Neovim fills both of these requirements. I
          configure Neovim in lua, and using a wide array <br />
          of plugins like lazy.nvim, alpha, and nvim-cmp. My Neovim
          configuration can be found at my
          <a href="https://github.com/evfeal/">GitHub</a> page.
        </p>
        <h3>Web Browser</h3>
        <p>
          Like distros and window managers, I have also gone through a ton of
          different web browsers, Chrome, Firefox, Ungoogled-Chromium, Brave,
          <br />etc. Out of those 4 specifically, I can at least reccomend one
          thing, DONT BE A CHROME NORMIE!!! Chrome has *numerous* problems
          regarding <br />
          Privacy, Security, and BLOAT so, so, much bloat. Firefox is a
          fantastic browser, and Brave is alright, though they do some shady
          <br />things with their cryptocurrency so I would personally reccomend
          against it. Ungoogled-Chromium is a solid choice, all of the speed of
          chrome without <br>the NSA Spyware! Personally though, I still use good
          old Firefox. Now that the web is being more and more dominated by
          chromium based browsers, <br>using Firefox allows you to be a member of
          the opposition to the increasing "chromification".
        </p>
        <h2>Hardware</h2>
        <h3>Laptop</h3>
        <p>
          My laptop is a Thinkpad E15 Gen 3, yeah yeah I know, its not an older,
          more customizable Thinkpad. I use a relatively modern thinkpad,
          <br />as opposed to the rest of the linux community, but at least its
          still a Thinkpad... right?
